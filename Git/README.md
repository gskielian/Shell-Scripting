GIT
===

Git is epic.  It just destroyed SVN and its competitors about 4 months ago, becoming just this year the defacto way tocollaborate on code.

You will need to learn the command line options to get the most out of Git (at least if you want to create directories).


To clone a repository type for example:
`git clone https://github.com/gskielian/Shell-Scripting.git`
In general it is:
`git clone [url]` 

Then you will have to cd into the directory and make changes there with either your cli skills.
