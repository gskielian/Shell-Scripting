##Key Pointers

When maneuvering the shell, you will need to be able to move quickly and minimize keypresses.

try the following on for size:


####Movement
- `<c-a>` move to the beginning of the line
- `<c-e>` move to the end of the line
- `alt + left arrow or right arrow` jump words


####Deleting
- `<c-k>` deletes everything to the right of the cursor
- `<c-u>` deletes everything to the left of the cursor

####Faster Execution
- Tab Completion, just press tab a lot (get into the habit) & see what it does.
- up and down arrows, these can search through past commmands so you can save on keypresses
- aliases -- a topic of their own, these can greatly abbreviate long commands
