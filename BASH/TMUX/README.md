Ever want to have split screen terminal?  
I have for a long, long time.

I've tried screen, but actually I prefer tmux over screen.


Basic Commands
* `<c-b> c` create a new session
* `<c-b> %` split screen vertically!
* `<c-b> "` split screen horizontally
* `<c-b> }` switch split screen


Here is a nice blog post with more details on how to use it:
